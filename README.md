# Alphabet

A successful company, but more importantly, an application to learn to type the alphabet as quickly as possible.

Includes statistics and obnoxious sounds!

# Requirements

Requires the sox utility (available on Linux, MacOS and Windows).

# Usage

`$ python3 alphabet.py ["alternative_string"]`

# Fun fact

Holding the Enter key down makes a pretty neat sound.
