# Alphabet

A successful company, but more importantly, an application to learn to type the alphabet as quickly as possible.

Includes statistics and obnoxious sounds!

## Requirements

Requires the sox utility (available on Linux, MacOS and Windows).

`$ apt-get install sox` or `$ pacman -Syu install sox` or `$ brew install sox` or zoop -> http://sox.sourceforge.net/.

## Usage

`$ python3 alphabet.py ["alternative_string"]`

## Examples

`$ python3 alphabet.py` -> Train the alphabet

`$ python3 alphabet.py "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"` -> Pangram practice

`$ python3 alphabet.py "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np"` -> Make Python a superset of MATLAB

## Fun fact

Holding the Enter key down makes a pretty neat sound.
